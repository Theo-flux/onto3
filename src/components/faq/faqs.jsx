        question: "How secure is my profile?",
        answer: `
            ONTO3 strives to be a trustworthy and secure place to launch Web 3.0 NFT
            Social Profiles. Finding and eliminating current vulnerabilities is a top priority of
            our and our team of developers work diligently to secure the platform from
            suspicious activity. Being one of the first applications of its type, we closely
            monitor the growing relationship we have with users and will continue to make it
            a safe place to launch a community. We follow all protocols to assure safe
            transactions and maintain privacy to stay inside the application. Users are
            required to provide a typed Signature Request via wallets for transactions.
            Account Verification is top priority and email input is required in addition to OTP
            Verification. Badge verification is something we are eventually going to input too.
            The importance of privacy in our application is monetized by Blockchain
            Technology and limited abilities inside the application to keep what is posted on
            ONTO3, in ONTO3.`
